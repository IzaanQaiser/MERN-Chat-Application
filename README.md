Project Overview:
This project presents a full-stack chat application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing users with real-time communication capabilities. The application utilizes Socket.IO for instant messaging, bcrypt.js for user authentication, and Tailwind CSS for frontend styling.

Features:

- Real-time messaging: Users can engage in real-time conversations with other users, with messages delivered instantly.
- User authentication: Secure user authentication is implemented to ensure the privacy and integrity of user interactions.
- Responsive design: The application features a responsive design, allowing seamless access from various devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used:
- MongoDB: Database solution for storing user data and chat histories.
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling server-side logic and API requests.
- React.js: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- Node.js: Runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
- Socket.IO: Library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- bcrypt.js: Library for password hashing and user authentication.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for efficient and responsive frontend styling.


Conclusion:
This full-stack chat application showcases the capabilities of the MERN stack in building real-time communication platforms. By following the provided instructions, users can deploy the application locally or customize it further to suit their specific requirements.

Need to do: add documentation and proof that this was actually made (images, videos, demos)
